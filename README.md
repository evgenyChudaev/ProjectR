# ProjectR
This repo contains run_analysis.R file that contains R code to clean and merge train/test datasets into 1 combined file. Once the file is cleaned and required columns are selected from the dataset, the script groups the dataset by subject and activity and finds the mean values for the numerica values that pertain to mean and standard deviation measures.

To run this script, put run_analysis.R in the same folder as UCI HAR Dataset (unzip it before that manually or uncomment script that unzips this folder and them put the run_analysis.R file in that folder).

Details about variables and other transformations can be found in CodeBook.md file.
